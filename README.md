# Collaborative-Filtering-Project
This was a project of CSE640 Collaborative Filtering course. We selected 4 papers on AutoEncoders and Variational AutoEncoders, ran their models on datasets other than used in the papers. 
The code folder contains the code implementations while report contains results of hyperparameter tuning and final evaluation on test set. More details are available in the report and the presentation video.
